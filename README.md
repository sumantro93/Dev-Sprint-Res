# Dev-Sprint
**Dev Sprint is an open activity where students and FOSS enthusiasts come together and solve bugs and issues in the code, docs and pretty much of everything which can make the project better. The idea is to enable students to squash bugs from a curated set of easy to hard fixes and make them confident. For this instance, we will have a Github repo (you can also have your repo in any version control). The issues tab will contain a bunch of issues which will be tagged with a key pair value describing the attribute. Like if it's an easy doc bug then it will contain, tags as (docs:easy)**

### Requirements

Easy set of bugs are to help students to understand Git workflow and making the first PR. Medium will require some specific skill set to address. Hard is for regular contributors or someone equally experienced.
